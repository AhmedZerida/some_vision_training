# Vision Small Projects

Welcome to the Vision Small Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of small projects aimed at training and improving your skills in computer vision, focusing on hand tracking, red color removel, virtual mouse control, and pose estimation.


## Projects
This repository includes the following projects:

1. **Hand Tracking**: Implementing hand tracking using computer vision techniques to detect and track the movement of hands in a video stream.
   
2. **Red Color Detection**: Developing a program to detect and track objects with a red color hue in real-time video streams or images.

3. **Virtual Mouse Control**: Creating a virtual mouse control system that allows users to control the mouse cursor using hand gestures or movements detected by a webcam.

4. **Pose Estimation**: Building a pose estimation system to detect and analyze the human pose from images or video streams.
